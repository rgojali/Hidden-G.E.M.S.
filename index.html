        <br>
        <p>Hidden GEMS (Green Effectiveness and Mindful Shopping) is a unique program with various classes from creative to business classes working together to give you an enriched set of skills to help you thrive. With the environment in mind, we also
            want to find solutions where we can turn something deemed unusable to something great and useful. We encourage the art of repurposing anything that we can give more life to and hopefully help us to be more mindful when we shop. </p>
